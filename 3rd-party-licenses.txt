 - @choojs/findup@0.2.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/choojs/findup.png)](http://travis-ci.org/choojs/findup)
@choojs/findup
=======

> This is a fork of [Filirom1/findup](https://github.com/Filirom1/findup), pending [#16](https://github.com/Filirom1/findup/pull/16).

### Install

```sh
npm install -g @choojs/findup
```

### Usage

Find up a file in ancestor's dir


    .
    ├── config.json
    └── f
        └── e
            └── d
                └── c
                    ├── b
                    │   └── a
                    └── config.json

### Options

- `maxdepth`: (Number, default -1) How far to traverse before giving up. If maxdepth is `-1`, then there is no limit.

#### Async

findup(dir, fileName, options, callback)
findup(dir, iterator, options, callback) with `iterator(dir, cb)` where cb only accept `true` or `false`

```js
var findup = require('@choojs/findup');


findup(__dirname + '/f/e/d/c/b/a', 'config.json', function(err, dir){
  // if(e) e === new Error('not found')
  // dir === '/f/e/d/c'
});
```

or

```js
findup(__dirname + '/f/e/d/c/b/a', function(dir, cb){
  require('path').exists(dir + '/config.json', cb);
}, function(err, dir){
  // if(e) e === new Error('not found')
  // dir === '/f/e/d/c'
});
```

#### EventEmitter

findup(dir, fileName, options)

```js
var findup = require('@choojs/findup');
var fup = findup(__dirname + '/f/e/d/c/b/a', 'config.json');
```

findup(dir, iterator, options) with `iterator(dir, cb)` where cb only accept `true` or `false`

```js
var findup = require('@choojs/findup');
var fup = findup(__dirname + '/f/e/d/c/b/a', function(dir, cb){
  require('path').exists(dir + '/config.json', cb);
});
```

findup return an EventEmitter. 3 events are emitted: `found`, `error`, `end`

`found` event is emitted each time a file is found.

You can stop the traversing by calling `stop` manually.

```js
fup.on('found', function(dir){
  // dir === '/f/e/d/c'
  fup.stop();
});
```

`error` event is emitted when error happens

```js
fup.on('error', function(e){
  // if(e) e === new Error('not found')
});
```

`end` event is emitted at the end of the traversing or after `stop()` is
called.

```js
fup.on('end', function(){
  // happy end
});
```

#### Sync

findup(dir, fileName)
findup(dir, iteratorSync) with `iteratorSync` return `true` or `false`
```js
var findup = require('@choojs/findup');

try{
  var dir = findup.sync(__dirname + '/f/e/d/c/b/a', 'config.json'); // dir === '/f/e/d/c'
}catch(e){
  // if(e) e === new Error('not found')
}
```

#### CLI
```js
npm install -g @choojs/findup

$ cd test/fixture/f/e/d/c/b/a/
$ findup package.json
/root/findup/package.json
```

Usage

```
$ findup -h

Usage: findup [FILE]

    --name, -n       The name of the file to found
    --dir, -d        The directoy where we will start walking up    $PWD
    --help, -h       show usage                                     false
    --verbose, -v    print log                                      false
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngxs-labs/immer-adapter/master/docs/assets/immer.png">
</p>

#### 📦 Install

To install `@ngxs-labs/immer-adapter` and `immer` that is a peer-dependency run the following command:

```console
npm install @ngxs-labs/immer-adapter immer
# or if you use yarn
yarn add @ngxs-labs/immer-adapter immer
```

##### Before

When your state is growing - it becomes harder to manage such mutations:

```ts
import { State, Action, StateContext } from '@ngxs/store';

export class FeedZebra {
  public static readonly type = '[Animals] Feed zebra';
  constructor(public payload: string) {}
}

@State<AnimalsStateModel>({
  name: 'animals',
  defaults: {
    zebra: {
      food: ['leaves', 'bark'],
      name: 'zebra'
    },
    panda: {
      food: [],
      name: 'panda'
    }
  }
})
export class AnimalState {
  @Selector()
  public static zebraFood(state: AnimalsStateModel): string[] {
    const zebraFood = [...state.zebra.food];
    zebraFood.reverse();
  }

  @Action(Add)
  public add({ getState, setState }: StateContext<AnimalsStateModel>, { payload }: Add): void {
    setState((state: AnimalsStateModel) => ({
      ...state,
      zebra: {
        ...state.zebra,
        food: [ ...state.zebra.food, payload ]
      }
    }));
  }
}
```

##### After

`immer-adapter` gives you the opportunity to manage mutations in a more declarative way:

```ts
import { ImmutableContext, ImmutableSelector } from '@ngxs-labs/immer-adapter';

@State<AnimalsStateModel>({
  name: 'animals',
  defaults: {
    zebra: {
      food: [],
      name: 'zebra'
    },
    panda: {
      food: [],
      name: 'panda'
    }
  }
})
export class AnimalState {
  @Selector()
  @ImmutableSelector()
  public static zebraFood(state: AnimalsStateModel): string[] {
    return state.zebra.food.reverse();
  }

  @Action(Add)
  @ImmutableContext()
  public add({ setState }: StateContext<AnimalsStateModel>, { payload }: Add): void {
    setState((state: AnimalsStateModel) => ({
      state.zebra.food.push(payload);
      return state;
    }));
  }
}
```

   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, You may not use the Work or Derivative Works for Commercial Purposes or Competitive Purposes. 

## 3. Grant of Patent License. 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Redistribution; Non-Commercial; Non-Competitive.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. 

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be (a) exclusively owned by Licensor (including all copyrights, patent rights and other intellectual property rights therein), and (b) under the terms and conditions of this License.

  * [Plotly Via Window Module](#plotly-via-window-module)
* [Development](#development)

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install angular-plotly.js plotly.js
```

Using the [angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) to start a new project
```bash
$ ng new my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install angular-plotly.js plotly.js --save
```

## Quick start

Add the `PlotlyModule` into the main app module of your project
```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

import * as PlotlyJS from 'plotly.js/dist/plotly.js';
import { PlotlyModule } from 'angular-plotly.js';

PlotlyModule.plotlyjs = PlotlyJS;

@NgModule({
    imports: [CommonModule, PlotlyModule],
    ...
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Then use the `<plotly-plot>` component to display the graph
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'plotly-example',
    template: '<plotly-plot [data]="graph.data" [layout]="graph.layout"></plotly-plot>',
})
export class PlotlyExampleComponent {
    public graph = {
        data: [
            { x: [1, 2, 3], y: [2, 6, 3], type: 'scatter', mode: 'lines+points', marker: {color: 'red'} },
            { x: [1, 2, 3], y: [2, 5, 3], type: 'bar' },
        ],
        layout: {width: 320, height: 240, title: 'A Fancy Plot'}
    };
}
```

You should see a plot like this:

<p align="center">
    <img src="example.png" alt="Example plot" width="320" height="240">
</p>


For a full description of Plotly chart types and attributes see the following resources:

**Note**: To make a plot responsive, i.e. to fill its containing element and resize when the window is resized, use `style` or `className` to set the dimensions of the element (i.e. using `width: 100%; height: 100%` or some similar values) and set `useResizeHandler` to `true` while setting `layout.autosize` to `true` and leaving `layout.height` and `layout.width` undefined. This will implement the behaviour documented here: https://plot.ly/javascript/responsive-fluid-layout/

```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'plotly-example',
    template: `
    <plotly-plot [data]="graph.data" [layout]="graph.layout"
       [useResizeHandler]="true" [style]="{position: 'relative', width: '100%', height: '100%'}">
    </plotly-plot>`,
})
export class PlotlyExampleComponent {
    public graph = {
        data: [{ x: [1, 2, 3], y: [2, 5, 3], type: 'bar' }],
        layout: {autosize: true, title: 'A Fancy Plot'},
    };
}
```

## Customizing the `plotly.js` bundle

By default, this library bundles `plotly.js` from the peer dependency together within the output. This results on huge outputs, for `plotly.js` itself is ~3MB when bundled. It also makes the build (with `ng serve --prod`) really slow, for it minifies everything together.

If you wish to optimize loading `plotly.js` in a different way, please check both [`PlotlyViaCDNModule`](#plotly-via-cdn-module) and [`PlotlyViaWindowModule`](#plotly-via-window-module) modules below.


### Plotly Via CDN Module

If you want to load `plotly.js` [from a CDN](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js#use-the-plotlyjs-cdn-hosted-by-fastly), use the `PlotlyViaCDNModule` and set on the `PlotlyViaCDNModule.plotlyVersion` property the plotly.js's version you want to use and, optionally, you can also set on the `PlotlyViaCDNModule.plotlyBundle` property the plotly.js's build you want to use:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

import { PlotlyViaCDNModule } from 'angular-plotly.js';


PlotlyViaCDNModule.plotlyVersion = '1.49.4'; // can be `latest` or any version number (i.e.: '1.40.0')
PlotlyViaCDNModule.plotlyBundle = 'basic'; // optional: can be null (for full) or 'basic', 'cartesian', 'geo', 'gl3d', 'gl2d', 'mapbox' or 'finance'

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        CommonModule,
        PlotlyViaCDNModule,
    ],
    ...
})
export class AppModule { }
```

### Plotly Via Window Module

`plotly.js` can be added as a [global script on angular.json](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-global-scripts#global-scripts) to avoid it being bundled into the final project's code. To make this happen, you must first add `plotly.js` path into `angular.json` file as shown below:

```javascript
// angular.json
{
    ...
    "projects": {
        "project-name": { // This is your project's name
            ...
            "architect": {
                "build": {
                    ...
                    "options": {
                        "scripts": [
                            "node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.min.js" // add this
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

This will include `plotly.js` into the `vendor.js` file generated by angular CLI build process, and `plotly.js` library will be loaded before angular and your project's code. The `window.Plotly` will be available. Thus, you must use `PlotlyViaWindowModule` module to force `angular-plotly.js` to use `window.Plotly` object:


```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

import { PlotlyViaWindowModule } from 'angular-plotly.js';

@NgModule({
    imports: [CommonModule, PlotlyViaWindowModule],
    ...
})
export class AppModule { }
```

If you want to use a [different precompiled bundle](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/dist/README.md#partial-bundles) or if you wish to [assemble you own customized bundle](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js#modules), you can use `PlotlyViaWindowModule` to force the use of `window.Plotly` object as shown above.

# array-bounds  [![experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-yellow.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/dfcreative/array-bounds.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dfcreative/array-bounds)

Find min and max values of a sequence of values/coordinates.

[![npm install array-bounds](https://nodei.co/npm/array-bounds.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/array-bounds/)

```js
const getBounds = require('array-bounds')

let bounds = getBounds([0, 25, 50, 75, 100]) // [0, 100]
```

## API

### box = bounds(array, dim=1)

Figures out bounds of sequence of points using dimensions `dim` as stride, ie. for 1d values expected data layout is `[x, x, x, ...]` for 2d is `[x, y, x, y, ...]`, etc. Returned array contains bounds for every dimension as `[minX, minY, ..., maxX, maxY]`, eg.

```js
//get bounding box
let [minX, minY, maxX, maxY] = bounds([x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ...], 2)

//get bounding cube
let [minX, minY, minZ, maxX, maxY, maxZ] = bounds([x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ...], 3)
```

Normalize array to unit length, that is 0..1 range. See [feature scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling).

[![npm install array-normalize](https://nodei.co/npm/array-normalize.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/array-normalize/)

```js
const normalize = require('array-normalize')

normalize([0, 50, 100]) // [0, .5, 1]
normalize([0, 0, .1, .2, 1, 2], 2) // [0, 0, .1, .1, 1, 1]
normalize([0, .25, 1, .25], 2, [0, .5, 1, .5]) // [0, .5, 1, .5])
```

## API

### array = normalize(array, dimensions=1, bounds?)

Normalizes n-dimensional array in-place using `dimensions` as stride, ie. for 1d array the expected data layout is `[x, x, x, ...]` for 2d is `[x, y, x, y, ...]`, etc.

Every dimension is normalized independently, eg. 2d array is normalized to unit square `[0, 0, 1, 1]`.

Optional `bounds` box can predefine min/max to optimize calculations.

# async-each

No-bullshit, ultra-simple, 35-lines-of-code async parallel forEach function for JavaScript.

We don't need junky 30K async libs. Really.

For browsers and node.js.

## Installation
* Just include async-each before your scripts.
* `npm install async-each` if you’re using node.js.
* `bower install async-each` if you’re using [Bower](http://bower.io).

## Usage

* `each(array, iterator, callback);` — `Array`, `Function`, `(optional) Function`
* `iterator(item, next)` receives current item and a callback that will mark the item as done. `next` callback receives optional `error, transformedItem` arguments.
* `callback(error, transformedArray)` optionally receives first error and transformed result `Array`.

Node.js:

```javascript
var each = require('async-each');
each(['a.js', 'b.js', 'c.js'], fs.readFile, function(error, contents) {
  if (error) console.error(error);
  console.log('Contents for a, b and c:', contents);
});
```

Browser:

```javascript
window.asyncEach(list, fn, callback);
```

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

bit-twiddle
===========

This is a collection of miscellaneous bit twiddling hacks ported to JavaScript, mostly taken from here:

http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html

Install
=======
Via npm:

    npm install bit-twiddle

Functions
=========

`sign(v)`
---------
Computes the sign of the integer v.  Returns:
* -1 if v < 0
*  0 if v === 0
* +1 if v > 0

`abs(v)`
--------
Returns the absolute value of the integer v

`min(x,y)`
----------
Computes the minimum of integers x and y

`max(x,y)`
----------
Computes the maximum of integers x and y

`isPow2(v)`
-----------
Returns `true` if v is a power of 2, otherwise false.

`log2(v)`
---------
Returns an integer approximation of the log-base 2 of v

`log10(v)`
----------
Returns log base 10 of v.

`popCount(v)`
-------------
Counts the number of bits set in v

`countTrailingZeros(v)`
-----------------------
Counts the number of trailing zeros.

`nextPow2(v)`
-------------
Rounds v up to the next power of 2.

`prevPow2(v)`
-------------
Rounds v down to the previous power of 2.

`parity(v)`
-----------
Computes the parity of the bits in v.

`reverse(v)`
------------
Reverses the bits of v.

`interleave2(x,y)`
------------------
Interleaves a pair of 16 bit integers.  Useful for fast quadtree style indexing.  (See wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve )

`deinterleave2(v, n)`
---------------------
Deinterleaves the bits of v, returns the nth part.  If both x and y are 16 bit, then it is true that:

    deinterleave2(interleave2(x,y), 0) === x
    deinterleave2(interleave2(x,y), 1) === y
    
`interleave3(x,y,z)`
--------------------

Interleaves a triple of 10 bit integers.  Useful for fast octree indexing.

`deinterleave3(v, n)`
---------------------
Same deal as `deinterleave2`, only for triples instead of pairs

`nextCombination(x)`
--------------------
Returns next combination ordered colexicographically.

### dist = calcSdf(source, options?)

Calculate distance field for the input `source` data, based on `options`. Returns 1-channel array with distance values from `0..1` range.

#### Source:

Type | Meaning
---|---
_Canvas_, _Context2D_ | Calculates sdf for the full canvas image data based on `options.channel`, by default `0`, ie. red channel.
_ImageData_ | Calculates sdf for the image data based on `options.channel`
_Uint8ClampedArray_, _Uint8Array_ | Handles raw pixel data, requires `options.width` and `options.height`. Stride is detected from `width` and `height`.
_Float32Array_, _Array_ | Handles raw numbers from `0..1` range, requires `options.width` and `options.height`. Stride is detected from `width` and `height`.

#### Options:

Property | Default | Meaning
---|---|---
`cutoff` | `0.25` | Cutoff parameter, balance between SDF inside `1` and outside `0` of glyph
`radius` | `10` | Max length of SDF, ie. the size of SDF around the `cutoff`
`width` | `canvas.width` | Width of input data, if array
`height` | `canvas.height` | Height of input data, if array
`channel` | `0` | Channel number, `0` is red, `1` is green, `2` is blue, `3` is alpha.
`stride` | `null` | Explicitly indicate number of channels per pixel. Not needed if `height` and `width` are provided.

# <img src="./logo.png" alt="bn.js" width="160" height="160" />

> BigNum in pure javascript

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)

## Install
`npm install --save bn.js`

## Usage

```js

var res = a.add(b);
console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047
```

**Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.

## Notation

### Prefixes

There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here
is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:

* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on
  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs
* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or
  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations
  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be
  added to the result to make it positive

### Postfixes

The only available postfix at the moment is:

* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript
  Number. Decimals are not supported.

### Examples

* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`
* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value
* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13

## Instructions

Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be
either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).

### Utilities

* `a.clone()` - clone number
* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)
* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero
  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding
* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,
  which must behave like an `Array`
* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For
  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:
  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`
* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied
* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits
  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)
* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied
* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative
* `a.isEven()` - no comments
* `a.isOdd()` - no comments
* `a.isZero()` - no comments
* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)
  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)
* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)
* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)
* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width
* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width
* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance

### Arithmetics

* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)
* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)
* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)
* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`
* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)
* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)
* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division

### Bit operations

* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced
  with `andn` in future)
* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`
* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set
* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)
* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number
* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)

### Reduction

* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD
* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)
* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`

## Fast reduction

When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
for [Mersenne Prime][1].

### Reduction context

To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:

```js
var red = BN.red(num);
```
where `num` is just a BN instance.

Or:

```js
var red = BN.red(primeName);
```

Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:

* `'k256'`
* `'p224'`
* `'p192'`
* `'p25519'`

Or:

```js
var red = BN.mont(num);
```

To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than
`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.

### Converting numbers

Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
to it. Usually, this means that one should:

* Convert inputs to reducted ones
* Operate on them in reduction context
* Convert outputs back from the reduction context

Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:

```js
var redA = a.toRed(red);
```
Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above

Here is how to convert them back:

```js
var a = redA.fromRed();
```

Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
counterparts in red context:

* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`
* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`
* `a.redShl(num)`

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - bn.js@5.1.3

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# <img src="./logo.png" alt="bn.js" width="160" height="160" />

> BigNum in pure javascript

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)

## Install
`npm install --save bn.js`

## Usage

```js
const BN = require('bn.js');

var a = new BN('dead', 16);
var b = new BN('101010', 2);

var res = a.add(b);
console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047
```

**Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.

## Notation

### Prefixes

There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here
is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:

* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on
  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs
* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or
  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations
  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be
  added to the result to make it positive

### Postfixes

* `n` - the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript
  Number. Decimals are not supported.
* `rn` - both argument and return value of the function are plain JavaScript
  Numbers. Decimals are not supported.

### Examples

* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`
* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value
* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13

## Instructions

Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be
either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).

### Utilities

* `a.clone()` - clone number
* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)
* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero
  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding
* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,
  which must behave like an `Array`
* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For
  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:
  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`
* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied
* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits
  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)
* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied
* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative
* `a.isEven()` - no comments
* `a.isOdd()` - no comments
* `a.isZero()` - no comments
* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)
  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)
* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)
* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)
* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width
* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width
* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance
* `BN.max(a, b)` - return `a` if `a` bigger than `b`
* `BN.min(a, b)` - return `a` if `a` less than `b`

### Arithmetics

* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)
* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)
* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)
* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`
* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)
* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)
* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division

### Bit operations

* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced
  with `andn` in future)
* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`
* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set
* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)
* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number
* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)

### Reduction

* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD
* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)
* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`

## Fast reduction

When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
for [Mersenne Prime][1].

### Reduction context

To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:

```js
var red = BN.red(num);
```
where `num` is just a BN instance.

Or:

```js
var red = BN.red(primeName);
```

Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:

* `'k256'`
* `'p224'`
* `'p192'`
* `'p25519'`

Or:

```js
var red = BN.mont(num);
```

To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than
`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.

### Converting numbers

Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
to it. Usually, this means that one should:

* Convert inputs to reducted ones
* Operate on them in reduction context
* Convert outputs back from the reduction context

Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:

```js
var redA = a.toRed(red);
```
Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above

Here is how to convert them back:

```js
var a = redA.fromRed();
```

### Red instructions

Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
counterparts in red context:

* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`
* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`
* `a.redShl(num)`
* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`
* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`
* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime
* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number
* `a.redNeg()`
* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation

### Number Size

Optimized for elliptic curves that work with 256-bit numbers.
There is no limitation on the size of the numbers.

> A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/),
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?
Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.

On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
`FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.

On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.

## Getting started
Install with npm:

```sh
npm install chokidar
```

Then `require` and use it in your code:

```javascript
var chokidar = require('chokidar');

// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles
chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {
  console.log(event, path);
});
```

```javascript
// Example of a more typical implementation structure:

// Initialize watcher.
var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,
  persistent: true
});

// Something to use when events are received.
var log = console.log.bind(console);
// Add event listeners.
watcher
  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));

// More possible events.
watcher
  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))
  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))
  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))
  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))
  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {
    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);
  });

// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {
  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);
});

// Watch new files.
watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);

// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem
var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();

// Un-watch some files.
watcher.unwatch('new-file*');

// Stop watching.
watcher.close();

// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)
chokidar.watch('file', {
  persistent: true,

  ignored: '*.txt',
  ignoreInitial: false,
  followSymlinks: true,
  cwd: '.',
  disableGlobbing: false,

  usePolling: true,
  interval: 100,
  binaryInterval: 300,
  alwaysStat: false,
  depth: 99,
  awaitWriteFinish: {
    stabilityThreshold: 2000,
    pollInterval: 100
  },

  ignorePermissionErrors: false,
  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)
});

```

## API

`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`

* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:

#### Persistence

* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.

#### Performance

* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the
`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.

#### Errors
* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
milliseconds.

### Methods & Events

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
`raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.
* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.

## CLI

If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.

## Install Troubleshooting

* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.

* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable "python" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`
  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:
    `npm config set python python2.7`

* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`
  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools

# color-normalize [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/colorjs/color-normalize.png)](https://travis-ci.org/colorjs/color-normalize) [![size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/color-normalize?label=size)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=color-normalize) ![stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-stable-green)

Convert any color argument (string, color, number, object etc.) to an array with channels data of desired output format.


## Usage

[![npm install color-normalize](https://nodei.co/npm/color-normalize.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/color-normalize/)

```js
const rgba = require('color-normalize')

rgba('red') // [1, 0, 0, 1]
rgba('rgb(80, 120, 160)', 'uint8') // Uint8Array<[80, 120, 160, 255]>
rgba('rgba(255, 255, 255, .5)', 'float64') // Float64Array<[1, 1, 1, .5]>
rgba('hsla(109, 50%, 50%, .75)', 'uint8') // Uint8Array<[87, 191, 64, 191]>
rgba(new Float32Array([0, 0.25, 0, 1]), 'uint8_clamped') // Uint8ClampedArray<[0, 64, 0, 255]>
rgba(new Uint8Array([0, 72, 0, 255]), 'array') // [0, 0.2823529411764706, 0, 1]

// ambivalent input
rgba([0,0,0]) // [0,0,0]
rgba([.5,.5,.5]) // [.5,.5,.5]
rgba([1,1,1]) // [1,1,1]
rgba([127,127,127]) // [.5,.5,.5]
rgba([255,255,255]) // [1,1,1]
```

Output format can be any [dtype](https://npmjs.org/package/dtype): `uint8`, `uint8_clamped`, `array`, `float32`, `float64` etc. By default it converts to `array` with `0..1` range values.

```

## API

### `let [r, g, b, alpha] = rgba(color)`

Returns channels values as they are in the input `color` string argument. `alpha` is always from `0..1` range. `color` can be a CSS color string, an array with channel values, an object etc., see [color-parse](https://ghub.io/color-parse).

Calculate kerning pairs for a font.

[![npm install detect-kerning](https://nodei.co/npm/detect-kerning.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/detect-kerning/)

```js
const kerning = require('detect-kerning')

let pairs = kerning('Roboto')

/*
{
	'A”': -10,
	'W.': -5,
	'P,': -3,
	...
}
*/

// get px kerning for 16px font-size
let px = 16 * pairs['AV'] / 1000
```

### `pairs = kerning(family|familyList, pairs|range|options?)`

Detect kerning pairs for the font family or stack of families and return their kerning in 1000 units/em. Optionally pass specific kerning pairs to check, or a unicode range, by default all printable ASCII character pairs are detected from the `[32, 126]` range. Alternatively, an options object can define:

* `options.pairs` - specific pairs to check;
* `options.range` - unicode range to detect pairs from;
* `options.fontSize` - base font size to use for check. Can affect performance, by default 16.
* `options.threshold` - font size (em) ratio to detect kerning, by default 0.05. Values below that number can bloat kerning table size.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## API

### ECDSA

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
var x = pubPoint.getX();
var y = pubPoint.getY();

// Public Key MUST be either:
// 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
// 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
// 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1
var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2
var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
// 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)

var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### EdDSA

```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### ECDH

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```

three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```

NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:

* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`

NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

# node-errno

> Better [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)/[io.js](https://iojs.org) error handling & reporting. Available in npm as *errno*.

* [Custom errors](#customerrors)

<a name="errnoexposed"></a>
## errno exposed

Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.

**By errno:**

```js
require('errno').errno[3]
// → {
//     "errno": 3,
//     "code": "EACCES",
//     "description": "permission denied"
//   }
```

**By code:**

```js
require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
// → {
//     "errno": 53,
//     "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
//     "description": "directory not empty"
//   }
```

**Make your errors more descriptive:**

```js
var errno = require('errno')

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'

  return str
}

var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
```

**Use as a command line tool:**

```
~ $ errno 53
{
  "errno": 53,
  "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
  "description": "directory not empty"
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  "errno": 56,
  "code": "EROFS",
  "description": "read-only file system"
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: "foo"
```

Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.

You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.

<a name="customerrors"></a>
## Custom errors

Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.

```js
var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
```

Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:

```js
fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
```

The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - esrecurse@4.3.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)

Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
recursive traversing functionality.

### Example Usage

The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(ast, {
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
```

We can use `Visitor` instance.

```javascript
var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});

visitor.visit(ast);
```

We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.

```javascript
class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
    constructor()
    {
        super(null);
    }

    XXXStatement(node) {
    }
}
```

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    this.visit(node.left);
    // do something...
    this.visit(node.right);
};
```

And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    // do something...
    this.visitChildren(node);
};
```

The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.
We can use user-defined node types.

```javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',

    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },

    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        // Extending the existing traversing rules.
        childVisitorKeys: {
            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
            TestExpression: ['argument']
        }
    }
);
```

We can use the `fallback` option as well.
If the `fallback` option is `"iteration"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: 'iteration'
    }
);
```

If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: function (node) {
            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
                return key !== 'argument'
            });
        }
    }
);
```

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Included are directions for opening issues, coding standards, and notes on development.

## Versioning

Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions, including new icons, without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes, changes to brand logos, and misc changes bumps the patch

## API

### `let metrics = measure(family, options?)`

Get metrics data for a font family or [CSS font string](), possibly with custom options. Font can be a string or an array with fonts.

#### `metrics`:

<img src="https://github.com/dy/font-measure/raw/master/sphinx.svg?sanitize=true" width="720"/>


#### `options`:

Property | Default | Meaning
---|---|---
`origin` | `top` | Origin for metrics. Can be changed to `baseline` or any other metric.
`fontSize` | `64` | Font-size to use for calculations. Larger size gives higher precision with slower performance.
`fontWeight` | `normal` | Font weight to use for calculations, eg. `bold`, `700` etc.
`fontStyle` | `normal` | Font style to use for calculations, eg. `italic`, `oblique`.
`canvas` | `measure.canvas` | Canvas to use for measurements.
`tittle` | `i` | Character to detect tittle. `null` disables calculation.
`descent` | `p` | Character to detect descent line. `null` disables calculation.
`ascent` | `h` | Character to detect ascent line. `null` disables calculation.
`overshoot` | `O` | Character to detect overshoot. `null` disables calculation.
`upper` | `H` | Character to detect upper line / cap-height. `null` disables calculation.
`lower` | `x` | Character to detect lower line / x-height. `null` disables calculation.

 - gl-util@3.1.3

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# gl-util [![unstable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/unstable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Set of practical functions for webgl.

[![npm install gl-util](https://nodei.co/npm/gl-util.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/gl-util/)

```js
const u = require('gl-util');

let gl = u.context(canvas)

let prog = u.program(gl, `
	precision mediump float;

	attribute vec2 position;

	void main() {
		gl_Position = vec4(position * 2. - 1., 0, 1);
	}

## API

### `context(container|canvas|options?)`

Create and/or return WebGL context for the canvas element, possibly based on options. If `container` is not defined, `document.body` is used.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `canvas` | A canvas element to obtain context for. |
| `container` | An element to create canvas in and return context for it. |
| `width` | If specified, will set the canvas width. |
| `height` | If specified, will set the canvas height. |
| `pixelRatio` | Multiplier for `width` and `height`. |
| `attributes` | Attributes object. Available attributes: `alpha`, `depth`, `stencil`, `antialias`, `premultipliedAlpha`, `preserveDrawingBuffer` and `failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat`. |

```js
const getContext = require('gl-util/context')

// create canvas element in the document.body and retrieve context for it
let gl = getContext({
	attributes: {
		antialias: true
	}
})
```

### `prog = program(gl, prog|vert?, frag?)`

Set active program or create a new program from vertex and fragment sources. Programs are cached for the context by source. The _WebGLProgram_ instance is returned.

```js
const program = require('gl-util/program')

// create and set program
let prog = program(gl, `
	precision mediump float;

	attribute vec2 position;

	void main() {
		gl_Position = vec4(position * 2. - 1., 0, 1);
	}
`, `
	precision mediump float;

	uniform sampler2D image;
	uniform vec2 shape;
	uniform float x;

	void main () {
		gl_FragColor = texture2D(image, gl_FragCoord.xy / shape);
	}
`)

// set active program
program(gl, prog)
```

### `unif = uniform(gl|program, {name: data, ...} | name?, data?)`

Get/set uniform or multiple uniforms. Returns an object with uniform parameters: `{name, location, data, type}`. Uniforms are stored per-program instance.

### `clear(gl, optsion?)`

Clear the viewport.

## Motivation

There are [regl](https://github.com/regl-project/regl), [stack.gl](https://github.com/stackgl/) and many other WegGL components or frameworks, so why gl-util?

* WebGL frameworks API is usually difficult to remember, not much better than pure WebGL, although _regl_ does a great job. _gl-util_ is like functions from any WebGL tutorial - tiny, handy and already familiar.
* _gl-util_ does not supersede WebGL API - that allows for debugging pure WebGL at any moment.
* _gl-util_ is tiny - if one needs minimalistic WebGL setup it may be better to opt for a couple of functions than massive stack.gl components or regl (70kb+).
* regl API may be cumbersome for organizing components

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - glslify-deps@1.3.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# glslify-deps

Walk the dependency graph of a [glslify](http://github.com/stackgl/glslify)
shader.

`glslify-deps` is responsible for resolving your shader's dependencies and
applying their transforms before the actual source modification occurs. You may
notice some parallels here with [browserify](http://browserify.org)'s
[module-deps](http://github.com/substack/module-deps) package.

While `glslify-deps` is an "internal" package for `glslify`, it may be useful
to use this package directly in specific cases, e.g. building a file tree
server-side but bundling the final shader on the client.

## Module API

There is an asynchronous and a synchronous API:

``` js
var glslifyDeps = require('glslify-deps')
var glslifyDepsSync = require('glslify-deps/sync')
```

The asynchronous API is documented below. For every method in the asychronous
API, instead of a `callback(err, result)`, the result is available as the return
value of the method.

### `depper = glslifyDeps([options])`

Creates a fresh `glslify-deps` instance. Accepts the following options:

* `cwd`: the current working directory to resolve relative file paths from.
* `readFile`: pass in a custom function reading files.
* `resolve`: pass in a custom function for resolving require calls. It has
  the same signature as [glsl-resolve](http://github.com/hughsk/glsl-resolve).
* `files`: a filename/source object mapping of files to prepopulate
  the file cache with. Useful for overriding particular file paths manually,
  most notably the "entry" file.

### `depper.transform(transform, [options])`

Adds a new transform – should be used before calling `depper.add`.

`transform` may either be a string (which is resolved like a `require` call),
or a function. More information on transforms can be found below.

### `depper.add(filename, [callback])`

Adds a new file to the dependency graph.

### `depper.inline(source, basedir, [callback])`

Adds a new inline file to the dependency graph, where `source` is the GLSL
source to include and `basedir` is the directory to pretend it's being
created in. A `basedir` is required to properly resolve requires and transforms,
and defaults to `process.cwd()`.

### `depper.on('file', cb(filename))`

Emitted whenever a new file has been included in the dependency graph.

## Example Output

``` json
[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "deps": { "glsl-random": 1 },
    "file": "index.glsl",
    "source": "precision mediump float;\n#pragma glslify: random = require(glsl-random)\n",
    "entry": true
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "deps": {},
    "file": "node_modules/glsl-random/index.glsl",
    "source": "highp float random(vec2 co)\n{\n    highp float a = 12.9898;\n    highp float b = 78.233;\n    highp float c = 43758.5453;\n    highp float dt= dot(co.xy ,vec2(a,b));\n    highp float sn= mod(dt,3.14);\n    return fract(sin(sn) * c);\n}\n\n#pragma glslify: export(random)",
    "entry": false
  }
]
```

## Transform API

The transform API has changed since glslify 1.0 to make it more "vanilla".

With the asynchronous API, transforms have this signature:

``` javascript
module.exports = function(file, source, options, done) {
  done(null, source.toUpperCase())
}
```

and using the synchronous API, transforms have this signature:

``` javascript
module.exports.sync = function(file, source, options) {
  return source.toUpperCase()
}
```

For an example that is compatible with both the async and sync APIs, here's
[glslify-hex](http://github.com/hughsk/glslify-hex)
rewritten using the new API:

``` javascript
var through = require('through')

var regexLong  = /#([a-f0-9]{2})([a-f0-9]{2})([a-f0-9]{2})([a-f0-9]{2})?/gi
var regexShort = /#([a-f0-9])([a-f0-9])([a-f0-9])([a-f0-9])?/gi

module.exports = transform
module.exports.sync = transform

function transform(filename, src, opts, done) {
  src = src.replace(regexShort, function(whole, r, g, b, a) {
    return !a
      ? '#' + r + r + g + g + b + b
      : '#' + r + r + g + g + b + b + a + a
  }).replace(regexLong, function(whole, r, g, b, a) {
    r = makeFloat(parseInt(r, 16) / 255)
    g = makeFloat(parseInt(g, 16) / 255)
    b = makeFloat(parseInt(b, 16) / 255)
    a = makeFloat(parseInt(a, 16) / 255)

    return isNaN(a)
      ? 'vec3('+[r,g,b].join(',')+')'
      : 'vec4('+[r,g,b,a].join(',')+')'
  })

  if (typeof done === 'function') done(null, src)
  return src
}

function makeFloat(n) {
  return String(n).indexOf('.') === -1
    ? n + '.'
    : n
}
```

## Transforms in `package.json`

Transforms now support options specified in `package.json`:

``` json
{
  "glslify": {
    "transform": [
       "glslify-hex",
      ["glslify-optimize", { "mangle": true }]
    ]
  }
}
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - hsluv@0.0.3

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# HSL<sub>uv</sub> - Human-friendly HSL

## Installation

Client-side: download [the latest hsluv.min.js](https://github.com/hsluv/hsluv/tree/master/javascript/dist).

Once this module is loaded in the browser, you can access it via the
global ``window.hsluv``.

Server-side: ``npm install hsluv``.

## Usage

Most functions take tuples, ie: Javascript arrays with three elements.  Make sure you are using
`func([a,b,c])` and not `func(a,b,c)`. If you are getting NaN for output then this is probably
the problem.

**hsluvToHex([hue, saturation, lightness])**

*hue* is a number between 0 and 360, *saturation* and *lightness* are
numbers between 0 and 100. This function returns the resulting color as
a hex string.

**hsluvToRgb([hue, saturation, lightness])**

Like above, but returns an array of 3 numbers between 0 and 1, for the
r, g, and b channel.

**hexToHsluv(hex)**

Takes a hex string and returns the HSLuv color as array that contains
the hue (0-360), saturation (0-100) and lightness (0-100) channel.
_Note:_ The result can have rounding errors. For example saturation can
be 100.00000000000007

**rgbToHsluv([red, green, blue])**

Like above, but *red*, *green* and *blue* are passed as numbers between
0 and 1.

Use **hpluvToHex**, **hpluvToRgb**, **hexToHpluv** and **rgbToHpluv** for
the pastel variant (HPLuv). Note that HPLuv does not contain all the colors
of RGB, so converting arbitrary RGB to it may generate invalid HPLuv colors.

For advance use cases, additional functions are avalible:

**hsluvToLch**, **lchToHsluv**

**hpluvToLch**, **lchToHpluv**

**rgbToXyz**, **xyzToRgb**

**rgbToLch**, **lchToRgb**

**luvToXyz**, **xyzToLuv**

**lchToLuv**, **luvToLch**

Also available for [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/). See
[here](https://github.com/hsluv/hsluv-stylus).

## Changelog

### 0.0.3

- Expose intermediate functions in the public API.

### 0.0.2

- Improve packaging and minification.

### 0.0.1

- Initial release under the name HSLuv. Old releases can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husl).

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - imurmurhash@0.1.4

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# is-mobile

Check if mobile browser, based on useragent string.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/is-mobile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/is-mobile)

## Example

```js
var mobile = require('is-mobile');

console.log(mobile());
// => false
```

## API

### mobile({ [ua], [tablet], [featureDetect] })

Returns true if a mobile browser is being used.

If you don't specify `opts.ua` it will use `navigator.userAgent`.

To add support for tablets, set `tablet: true`.

To enable feature detection (i.e. namely for iPad with iOS 13), set `featureDetect: true` and `tablet: true`. This will only work in browser environments.

`opts.ua` can also be an instance of a [node.js http request](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_incomingmessage), in which
case it will reader the user agent header.

Example:

```js
var http = require('http');
var mobile = require('is-mobile');

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.end(mobile(req));
});

server.listen(8000);
```

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install is-mobile
```

Bundle for the browser with
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).

GPL version 3
=============

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# μMath [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dfcreative/mumath.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dfcreative/mumath) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/dfcreative/mumath/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dfcreative/mumath) <a href="UNLICENSE"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/PD-icon.svg" width="20"/></a>

Set of practical math utils to shorten code.

[`$ npm install mumath`](https://npmjs.org/package/mumath)

```js
var round = require('mumath/round');
round(123.32, .5); //123.5

//require any function as
//var <fn> = require('mumath/<fn>');
```

## API

### `round(value, step?)`

Rounds value to optional `step`.

`round(0.3, .5)` → `.5`


### `len(a, b)`

Return length of a vector.


### `precision(value)`

Get precision from float:

`1.1 → 1, 1234 → 0, .1234 → 4`


### `clamp(value, left, right)`

Return value clamped by left/right limits (or vice-versa).


### `lerp(x, y, ratio)`

Return value interpolated between x and y.


### `within(value, left, right)`

Whether element is between left & right, including.


### `mod(value, min?, max)`

An enhanced [mod-loop](http://npmjs.org/package/mod-loop) — loops value within a frame.


### `closest(value, list)`

Get closest value out of a set.


### `scale(value, list)`

Get first scale out of a list of basic scales, aligned to the power. E. g.

`step(.37, [1, 2, 5])` → `.5`
`step(456, [1, 2])` → `1000`

Similar to closest, but takes all possible powers of scales.

### `order(value)`

Get order of magnitude for a number.

`order(123) → 100; order(-0.0003) → 0.0001;`


### `isMultiple(a, b, eps?)`

Same as `a % b === 0`, but with precision check.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - murmurhash-js@1.0.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# MurmurHash.js

An optimized JavaScript implementation of the MurmurHash algorithms.

These algorithms take a JavaScript string (and a seed), and quickly create a non-cryptographic 32-bit hash from it. And by quick I mean sub-millisecond performance.

More information about these algorithms can be found at:

*	[MurmurHash Homepage](http://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/)
*	[Wikipedia Entry on MurmurHash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) 

## Install

    npm install murmurhash-js
    
## API

```javascript
var murmur = require("murmurhash-js")
```

### Methods

#### `murmur.murmur2(key, seed)`
Runs the murmur2 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.

#### `murmur.murmur3(key, seed)`
Runs the murmur3 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.

**Note** `require("murmur-hash")` is the same as `murmur.murmur3`

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - normalize-svg-path@0.1.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# normalize-svg-path

  Convert all segments in a path to curves. Usefull if you intend to animate one shape to another. By defining all segments with curves instead of a mix of lines, arcs, and curves tweening becomes much simpler. It could also help you rewrite your SVG code according to the principles of [narcissistic design](//vimeo.com/77199361).

## Installation

With your favourite package manager:

- [packin](//github.com/jkroso/packin): `packin add normalize-svg-path`
- [component](//github.com/component/component#installing-packages): `component install jkroso/normalize-svg-path`
- [npm](//npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-install.html): `npm install normalize-svg-path`

then in your app:

```js
var normalize = require('normalize-svg-path')
```

## API

### normalize(path)

  Translate each segment in `path` to an equivalent cubic bézier curve. The input `path` must be [absolute](//github.com/jkroso/abs-svg-path).

```js
normalize([['L',1,2]]) // => [['C',0,0,1,2,1,2]]
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

Numeric Javascript by Sébastien Loisel
======================================

Numeric Javascript is a javascript library for doing numerical
analysis in the browser. Because Numeric Javascript uses only the
javascript programming language, it works in many browsers and does
not require powerful servers.

Numeric Javascript is for building "web 2.0" apps that can perform
complex calculations in the browser and thus avoid the latency of
asking a server to compute something. Indeed, you do not need a
powerful server (or any server at all) since your web app will perform
all its calculations in the client.

For further information, see http://www.numericjs.com/
Discussion forum: http://groups.google.com/group/numericjs

License
-------

Numeric Javascript is copyright by Sébastien Loisel and is distributed
under the MIT license. Details are found in the license.txt file.

Dependencies
------------

There are no dependencies for numeric.js.

Subdirectories
--------------

Here are some of the subdirectories and their contents:

* / holds the html/php files for the workshop/web site, license.txt, README, etc...

* /src holds the source files. The .js files are concatenated together to produce lib/numeric.js

* /lib holds numeric.js and numeric-min.js. These files aren't checked into the git tree because
they are created from the files in the /src subdirectory.

* /resources holds some small images, css files, etc...

* /tools contains build/test scripts. If you're going to patch or otherwise make tweaks to numeric,
you will need to use the /tools/build.sh script. There are also a bunch of scripts to deploy to
the numericjs.com web site, which you probably won't need.

Building and testing
--------------------

If you tweak the code, you can build and test the library by running the script /tools/build.sh. If you plan
to send me patches, please at least run this build script and check that all the tests pass.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# pick-by-alias [![unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-green.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Pick object properties by synonyms. Useful to avoid remembering exact option names from user perspective.

[![npm install pick-by-alias](https://nodei.co/npm/pick-by-alias.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/pick-by-alias/)

```js
let pick = require('pick-by-alias')

let result = pick({
  positions: [...],
  color: 'rgba(0, 100, 200, .75)',
  viewBox: null,
  extra: 123
}, {
  positions: 'positions points data coordinates',
  color: 'colors color stroke',
  viewport: 'viewport viewBox'
})
```

### `pick(object, properties, keepRest=false)`

Return an object with properties picked by the list or dict with aliases. Aliases are matched in priority order, ie. first matching name is picked. Each alias can be an array or a comma/space-separated string.

```js
// pick by dict
let {a, b} = pick(src, {a: ['a', 'b', 'c'], b: 'd e f'})

// pick by list
let {c, d, e} = pick(src, ['c', 'd', 'e'])

// pick by string
let {f, g} = pick(src, 'f g')
```

`keepRest` defines if not listed object properties should be transfered to resulting object or discarded.

     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
     Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
     excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
     subsequently incorporated within the Work.

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
     as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
     meet the following conditions:

     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that You changed the files; and

     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
         the Derivative Works; and

     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
         as modifying the License.

     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
     the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - run-queue@1.0.3

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# run-queue

A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.

```js
const RunQueue = require('run-queue')

const queue = new RunQueue({
  maxConcurrency: 1
})

queue.add(1, example, [-1])
for (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {
  queue.add(0, example, [ii])
}
const finished = []
queue.run().then(
  console.log(finished)
})

function example (num, next) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    finished.push(num)
    next()
  }, 5 - Math.abs(num))
}
```

would output

```
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ]
```

If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:

```
[ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ]
```

The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take
longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the
next priority level is run.  See
[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is
even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue
can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:

```
[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]
```

## API

### const queue = new RunQueue(options)

Create a new queue. Options may contain:

* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.
* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.

### queue.add (prio, fn, args)

Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`
with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.

### queue.run ()

Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either
all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a
rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected
with that error and no further queue running will be done.

## PRIORITIES

Priorities are any integer value >= 0.

Lowest is executed first.

Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue
must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.

This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`
must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs
while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`
queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs
complete.

    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

simplicial-complex
==================

This CommonJS module implements basic topological operations and indexing for [abstract simplicial complexes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_simplicial_complex) (ie graphs, triangular and tetrahedral meshes, etc.) in JavaScript.

What is an (abstract) simplicial complex?
-----------------------------------------

An [abstract simplicial complex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_simplicial_complex) is a higher dimensional generalization of the concept of a [(directed) graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_\(mathematics\)), and it plays a fundamental role in computational geometry.  Recall that a graph is represented by a pair of sets called:

* [vertices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_\(graph_theory\)) : A finite collection of labels/indices.
* [edges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_\(graph_theory\)) : A finite collection of ordered pairs of vertices.

In an oriented abstract simplicial complex, the edges of a graph are replaced by higher dimensional structures called *cells* or *simplices*, which are represented by ordered tuples of vertices.  And so we can represent a simplicial complex using the following data:

* [vertices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_\(graph_theory\)) : A finite collection of labels/indices. (Same as before)
* [cells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex) : A finite collection of ordered [tuples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) of vertices.

We say that the dimension of each cell is one less than the length of its tuple.  For example, here are some common names for various n-dimensional cells:

* -1 - cells: The empty cell
* 0 - cells: Vertices
* 1 - cells: Edges
* 2 - cells: Faces/triangles
* 3 - cells: Volumes/tetrahedra/solids
*  ...
* n-cells: n-simplices/facets

You probably already know of many examples of simplicial complexes.  Triangular meshes (as commonly used in computer graphics) are just 2d simplicial complexes; as are [Delaunay triangulations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation).  A more restricted example of a simplicial complex is the notion of a [hypergraph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph), which is basically what you get when you forget the ordering of each cell.

How does this library work?
---------------------------

Recall that for graphs, there are two basic ways we can represent them:

* [Adjacency Lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list): A list of edges
* [Adjacency Matrices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix): A table of all edge-vertex incidences

The first form is better for sparse graphs, while the latter may be more efficient if the graph is dense.  These techniques directly generalize to simplicial complexes as well, and suggest two basic strategies:

* **Adjacency List**: A flat list of cells
* **Adjacency Tensor**: As a (n+1)^d dimensional tensor, where the each entry represents a cell

The first approach generalizes the [adjacency list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) storage format for a graph, while the second form generalizes the [adjacency matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix).  In the first case, the storage scales linearly as O(v + d * c), while in the later case the storage scales as O(v^d).  When the total number of cells is very large and d is very small, adjacency matrix representations may be acceptable.  On the other hand, for large values of d adjacency lists scale far better.  As a result, we categorically adopt the first form as our representation.

In an adjacency list, it is trivial to test if a lower dimensional cell is incident to a higher dimensional.  However, if executed naively the reverse operation can be very inefficient.  (For example, finding all of the edges incident to a particular vertex would take O(number of edges) time if no preprocessing were used.)  To avoid having to do this, we introduce the concept of a *topological index*.  A topological index is basically a table that records the collection of all cells incident to a particular cell.  Building these tables can be done in linear time, and once complete they can answer any topological query in O(1).  To use these tools, please look at the `incidence` and `dual` functions.

Usage
=====

First, you need to install the library using [npm](https://npmjs.org/):

    npm install simplical-complex
    
And then in your scripts, you can just require it like usual:

```javascript
var top = require("simplicial-complex")
```

`simplicial-complex` represents cell complexes as arrays of arrays of vertex indices.  For example, here is a triangular mesh:

```javascript
var tris = [
    [0,1,2],
    [1,2,3],
    [2,3,4]
  ]
```

And here is how you would compute its edges:

```javascript
var edges = top.unique(top.skeleton(tris, 1))

//Result:
//  edges = [ [0,1],
//            [0,2],
//            [1,2],
//            [1,3],
//            [2,3],
//            [2,4],
//            [3,4] ]
```

The functionality in this library can be broadly grouped into the following categories:

Structural
----------

### `dimension(cells)`
**Returns:** The dimension of the cell complex.

**Time complexity:** `O(cells.length)`

### `countVertices(cells)`
**Returns:** The number of vertices in the cell complex

**Time complexity:**  `O(cells.length * dimension(cells))`

### `cloneCells(cells)`
Makes a copy of a cell complex

* `cells` is an array of cells

**Returns:** A deep copy of the cell complex

**Time complexity:** `O(cells.length * dimension(cells))`


### `compareCells(a, b)`
Ranks a pair of cells relative to one another up to permutation.

* `a` is a cell
* `b` is a cell

**Returns** a signed integer representing the relative rank:
* < 0 : `a` comes before `b`
* = 0 : `a = b` up to permutation
* > 0 : `b` comes before `a`

**Time complexity:** `O( a.length * log(a.length) )`

### `normalize(cells[, attr])`
Canonicalizes a cell complex so that it is possible to compute `findCell` queries.  Note that this function is done **in place**.  `cells` will be mutated.  If this is not acceptable, you should make a copy first using `cloneCells`.

* `cells` is a complex.
* `attr` is an optional array of per-cell properties which is permuted alongside `cells`

**Returns:** `cells`

**Time complexity:** `O(dimension(cells) * cells.length * log(cells.length) )`

### `unique(cells)`
Removes all duplicate cells from the complex.  Note that this is done **in place**.  `cells` will be mutated.  If this is not acceptable, make a copy of `cells` first.

* `cells` is a `normalize`d complex

**Returns:** `cells`

**Time complexity:** `O(cells.length)`

### `findCell(cells, c)`
Finds a lower bound on the first index of cell `c` in a `normalize`d array of cells.

* `cells` is a `normalize`'d array of cells
* `c` is a cell represented by an array of vertex indices

**Returns:** The index of `c` in the array if it exists, otherwise -1

**Time complexity:** `O(d * log(d) * log(cells.length))`, where `d = max(dimension(cells), c.length)`

Topological
-----------

### `explode(cells)`
Enumerates all cells in the complex, with duplicates

* `cells` is an array of cells

**Returns:** A normalized list of all cells in the complex

**Time complexity:** `O(2^dimension(cells) * dimension(cells) * cells.length * log(cells.length))`

### `skeleton(cells, n)`
Enumerates all n cells in the complex, with duplicates

* `cells` is an array of cells
* `n` is the dimension of the cycles to compute

**Returns:**  A normalized list of all n-cells

**Time complexity:** `O(dimension(cells)^n * cells.length * log(cells.length))`

### `boundary(cells)`
Enumerates all boundary cells of the cell complex

* `cells` is an array of cells

**Returns:** A normalized list of cells

**Time complexity:** `O(dimension(cells) * cells.length * log(cells.length))`

### `incidence(from_cells, to_cells)`
Builds an index for [neighborhood queries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh#Summary_of_mesh_representation) (aka a sparse incidence matrix).  This allows you to quickly find the cells in `to_cells` which are incident to cells in `from_cells`.

* `from_cells` a `normalize`d array of cells
* `to_cells` a list of cells which we are going to query against

**Returns:** An array with the same length as `from_cells`, the `i`th entry of which is an array of indices into `to_cells` which are incident to `from_cells[i]`.

**Time complexity:** `O(from_cells.length + d * 2^d * log(from_cells.length) * to_cells.length)`, where `d = max(dimension(from_cells), dimension(to_cells))`.

### `dual(cells[, vertex_count])`
Computes the [dual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph#Incidence_matrix) of the complex.  An important application of this is that it gives a more optimized way to build an index for vertices for cell complexes with sequentially enumerated vertices.  For example,

```javascript
dual(cells)
```

Is equivalent to finding the incidence relation for all vertices, or in other words doing:

```javascript
incidence(unique(skeleton(cells, 0)), cells)
```

For the arguments:

* `cells` is a cell complex
* `vertex_count` is an optional parameter giving the number of vertices in the cell complex.  If not specified, then it calls `top.incidence(top.unique(top.skeleton(cells, 0)), cells)`

**Returns:** An array of elements with the same length as `vertex_count` (if specified) or `unique(skeleton(cells,0))` otherwise giving the [vertex stars of the mesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(graph_theory\)) as indexed arrays of cells.

**Time complexity:** `O(dimension(cells) * cells.length)`

### `connectedComponents(cells[, vertex_count])`
Splits a simplicial complex into its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(topology)">connected components</a>.  If `vertex_count` is specified, we assume that the cell complex is dense -- or in other words the vertices of the cell complex is the set of integers [0, vertex_count).  This allows for a slightly more efficient implementation.  If unspecified, a more general but less efficient sparse algorithm is used.

* `cells` is an array of cells
* `vertex_count` (optional) is the result of calling `countVertices(cells)` or in other words is the total number of vertices.

**Returns:** An array of cell complexes, one per each connected component.  Note that these complexes are not normalized.

**Time complexity:**

* If `vertex_count` is specified:  `O(vertex_count + dimension(cells)^2 * cells.length)`
* If `vertex_count` is not specified: `O(dimension(cells)^3 * log(cells.length) * cells.length)`

[![npm install string-split-by](https://nodei.co/npm/string-split-by.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/string-split-by/)


```js
var split = require('string-split-by')

split('a."b.c".d.{.e.f.g.}.h', '.')
// ['a', '"b.c"', 'd', '{.e.f.g.}', 'h']

split('a."b.c".d.{.e.f.g.}.h', '.', {ignore: '""'})
// ['a', '"b.c"', 'd', '{', 'e', 'f', 'g', '}', 'h']
```

## API

### parts = splitBy(string, separator, options?)

Return array with parts split from string by a separator, which can be whether _String_ or _RegExp_. Options can define:

Option | Default | Meaning
---|---|---
`ignore` | ``['"', "'", '`', '“”', '«»', '[]', '()', '{}']`` | Avoid splitting content enclosed in the character pairs. Can be a string or a list of strings.
`escape` | `true` | Avoid splitting at the escaped separator, eg. `\.` won't be separated by `'.'` separator.

const getBounds = require('svg-path-bounds')

let [left, top, right, bottom] = getBounds('M0 0L10 10 20 0Z')
```

## API

### bounds = getBounds(path|segments)

Calculate bounding box for [svg path data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d) string or [parsed path segments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-svg-path) array. The box is detected by controlling points, not the real path.

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# svg-path-sdf [![experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-green.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Create signed distance field for an svg path data.

![svg-path-sdf](https://github.com/dy/svg-path-sdf/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true)

## Usage

[![npm install svg-path-sdf](https://nodei.co/npm/svg-path-sdf.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/svg-path-sdf/)

```js
let pathSdf = require('svg-path-sdf')

let arr = pathSdf('M40,0A40,40 0 1,1 0,-40A40,40 0 0,1 40,0Z', {
	width: 200,
	height: 200
})
```

`arr` has `200×200` elements with value from `0..1` range, corresponding to distance. The path is drawn at the center of the sdf fitting to the minimum side.

## distances = pathSdf(path, options|shape?)

Option | Meaning
---|---
`width`,`w`, `height`,`h` or `shape` | Output sdf size in px, defaults to `200×200`.
`cutoff`, `radius` | SDF parameters for [bitmap-sdf](https://github.com/dy/bitmap-sdf), by default detected from shape to fit min side.
`viewBox` | View box for the path data. If not defined, it is detected as path bounds via [svg-path-bounds](https://github.com/dy/svg-path-bounds).
`stroke` | Whether to stroke shape. Positive number will stroke outside the amount of pixels, negative number will stroke inside, `0`-ish will disable stroke.

Turn any binary data container into an _ArrayBuffer_ in sync way. Detected containers:

* Buffer
* TypedArray
* ArrayBufferView
* ArrayBuffer
* data-uri string
* base64 string
* plain string
* Array
* Array of Arrays
* Number (creates new ArrayBuffer of the defined length in bytes)
* etc.

It also handles some custom data types, like `ImageData`, `AudioBuffer` etc., but in general it returns `null` for objects not looking like binary data containers. Note also that it does not handle _Blob_ and _File_, since they require async API.

[![npm install to-array-buffer](https://nodei.co/npm/to-array-buffer.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/to-array-buffer/)

```js
var toArrayBuffer = require('to-array-buffer')
var context = require('audio-context')

// Get array buffer from any object
ab = toArrayBuffer(new Buffer(100))
ab = toArrayBuffer(new Float32Array(12))
ab = toArrayBuffer(dataURIstr)
ab = toArrayBuffer(base64str)
ab = toArrayBuffer(ndarray)
ab = toArrayBuffer([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]])
```

# Introduction

A MD5 implementation for TypeScript

* Can handle Unicode strings
* Supports incremental hashing
* Works with Files and Blobs

This library also includes tools for:

* Hashing a file or blob
* A webworker for performing hashing
* A webworker handler for requesting files or blobs to be hashed
     * promise based
     * files or blobs are queued for processing on the webworker


Based on work by

* Joseph Myers: http://www.myersdaily.org/joseph/javascript/md5-text.html
* André Cruz: https://github.com/satazor/SparkMD5
* Raymond Hill: https://github.com/gorhill/yamd5.js


## Usage

### Basic Hashing

1. Import the class
     * `import {Md5} from 'ts-md5/dist/md5';`
2. Hash some things
     * `Md5.hashStr('blah blah blah')` => hex:string
     * `Md5.hashStr('blah blah blah', true)` => raw:Int32Array(4)
     * `Md5.hashAsciiStr('blah blah blah')` => hex:string
     * `Md5.hashAsciiStr('blah blah blah', true)` => raw:Int32Array(4)

For more complex uses:

```typescript

md5 = new Md5();

// Append incrementally your file or other input
// Methods are chainable
md5.appendStr('somestring')
    .appendAsciiStr('a different string')
    .appendByteArray(blob);

// Generate the MD5 hex string
md5.end();

```


### Hashing a File

NOTE:: You have to make sure `ts-md5/dist/md5_worker.js` is made available in your build so it can be accessed directly by a browser
It should always remain as a seperate file.

```typescript

import {ParallelHasher} from 'ts-md5/dist/parallel_hasher';

let hasher = new ParallelHasher('/path/to/ts-md5/dist/md5_worker.js');
hasher.hash(fileBlob).then(function(result) {
   console.log('md5 of fileBlob is', result);
});

```


## Building from src

The project is written in typescript and transpiled into ES5.

1. Install TypeScript: `npm install -g typescript` (if you haven't already)
2. Configure compile options in `tsconfig.json`
3. Perform build using: `tsc`

You can find more information here: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json

## Type Definitions

These allow projects like jasmine to work with .ts files. This is here as a guide more than anything else.
See: https://github.com/typings/typings

1. Install typings: `npm install typings --global` (if you haven't already)
2. Download definitions: `typings install jasmine --ambient --save`
     * Note: ambient means we are searching in https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped
3. Reference the typings using `/// <reference path="../typings/main.d.ts" />` from tests

To update typings:

*  From command line run: `typings install`


## Scripts

1. Build Script: `npm run build`
2. Test Script: `npm run test`


## Publishing

1. Sign up to https://www.npmjs.com/
2. Configure `package.json` https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json
3. run `npm publish` https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish

`union-find`
==========

A basic union-find data structure for node.js.  For more information, see wikipdia:

[Disjoint Set Datastructures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)


Usage
=====
Here is an example showing how to do connected component labelling.  Assume we are given a graph with `VERTEX_COUNT` vertices and a list of edges stored in array represented by pairs of vertex indices:

    //Import data structure
    var UnionFind = require('union-find');
    
    //Link all the nodes together
    var forest = new UnionFind(VERTEX_COUNT);
    for(var i=0; i<edges.length; ++i) {
      forest.link(edges[i][0], edges[i][1]);
    }
    
    //Label components
    var labels = new Array(VERTEX_COUNT);
    for(var i=0; i<VERTEX_COUNT; ++i) {
      labels[i] = forest.find(i);
    }

Installation
============

    npm install union-find

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - uri-js@3.0.2

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# URI.js

URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc).
It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)) and IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)) specifications.

URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 5.6kb (gzipped, 15kb deflated).

## API

### Parsing & Validating

	var components = URI.parse("uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  scheme : "uri",
	//  userinfo : "user:pass",
	//  host : "example.com",
	//  port : 123,
	//  path : "/one/two.three",
	//  query : "q1=a1&q2=a2",
	//  fragment : "body"
	//}

### Serializing

	URI.serialize({scheme : "http", host : "example.com", fragment : "footer"}) === "http://example.com/#footer"

### Resolving

	URI.resolve("uri://a/b/c/d?q", "../../g") === "uri://a/g"

### Normalizing

	URI.normalize("HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html") === "http://abc.com/~smith/home.html"

### Comparison

	URI.equal("example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D", "eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d") === true

### IRI Support

	//convert IRI to URI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://examplé.org/rosé")) === "http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"
	//convert URI to IRI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"), {iri:true}) === "http://examplé.org/rosé"

### Options

All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:

*	`scheme` (string)

	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.

*	`reference` (string)

	If set to `"suffix"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.

*	`tolerant` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.

*	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.

*	`iri` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`domainHost` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).

## Scheme Extendable

URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:

*	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\]
*	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\]
*	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\]
*	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\]
*	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]

### HTTP Support

	URI.equal("HTTP://ABC.COM:80", "http://abc.com/") === true

### Mailto Support

	URI.parse("mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "mailto",
	//	to : ["alpha@example.com", "bravo@example.com"],
	//	subject : "SUBSCRIBE",
	//	body : "Sign me up!"
	//}

	URI.serialize({
		scheme : "mailto",
		to : ["alpha@example.com"],
		subject : "REMOVE",
		body : "Please remove me",
		headers : {
			cc : "charlie@example.com"
		}
	}) === "mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me"

## Usage

To load in a browser, use the following tag:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js"></script>

To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:

	npm install uri-js

Then, in your code, load it using:

	var URI = require("uri-js");

If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:

	import * as URI from "uri-js";

Or you can load just what you need using named exports:

	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from "uri-js";

## Breaking changes from 2.x

URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.

## Breaking changes from 1.x

The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.

 - weak-map@1.0.5

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

`WeakMap` is a collection slated to be introduced to JavaScript with
EcmaScript 6.  It provides a mapping from objects to values, but allows
any entry to be garbage collected if the key is provably lost.

In order for it to be possible that a key is provably lost, weak maps do
not provide a way to access the key list.

This is a Node Packaged Module (NPM) that provides a shim and patcher
for missing or broken WeakMap implementations suitable for use in
Node.js and browsers that provide the EcmaScript 5 property description
interfaces provided that it hosted by a CommonJS loader or bundler like
[Browserify][], [Montage][], [Mr][], or [Mop][].

[Browserify]: https://github.com/substack/node-browserify
[Montage]: https://github.com/montagejs/mr
[Mr]: https://github.com/montagejs/mr
[Mop]: https://github.com/montagejs/mop

```
npm install weak-map --save
```

```javascript
var WeakMap = require("weak-map");
var map = new WeakMap();
var key = {};
map.set(key, "Hello, World!");
map.get(key) === "Hello, World!";
key = null;
// "Hello, World!" may be collected
```

See [MDN][] for the API details.

[MDN]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap

At time of writing, prototype implementations of `WeakMap` exist in V8
and Spidermonkey.  The prototype is available in Node.js v0.10 with the
`--harmony_collections` V8 option.  In v0.8, it was available with
`--harmony_weakmaps`.  The purpose of this package is to enable
dependees to use weak maps regardless of whether they are implemented by
the underlying engine, albeit in a way that leaks memory in some
non-obvious cases.

### Purpose and limitation

This shim depends on and modifies ECMAScript 5 property descriptor related
methods, `Object.defineProperty`, `Object.getOwnPropertyNames`,
`Object.isExtensible`, `Object.freeze`, and `Object.seal`.

In a nutshell, the WeakMap shim emulates a WeakMap by adding a hidden
property to the key that associates the weak map with the retained
object. The shim overrides the ECMAScript 5 methods to cover its tracks.

Consider a scenario that only includes a weak map, a key, and a corresponding
value through the weak map. With a proper `WeakMap`, built into the JavaScript
engine privy to the internals of the garbage collector, the `value` would be
retained either by the key or the weak map. If *either* the key or the weak map
are elligible for garbage collection, the value is elligible.

This is in contrast to to a plain `Map`. In a scenario with a map, a key, and a
value corresponding to the key through the map, neither the key nor the value
will be eligible for garbage collection until the map containing them is
elligible. Thus, if a map is used to establish a relationship between ephemeral
keys and values, it will accumulate garbage.

This shim does its best to approximate a proper `WeakMap` without an intimate
relationship with the garbage collector. In the same scenario, the value will
become elligible for garbage collection if the key is elligible. Unlike a proper
weak map, if the weak map shim becomes elligible for garbage collection but the
key is retained by something else, the value will be retained. In this scenario,
all operations of the weak map take constant time.

However, if the key is *frozen*, the weak map retains both the key and the value
and neither are elligible for collection until the weak map becomes elligible
itself. This scenario is unfortunately identical to the behavior of a `Map`.
Additionally, all operations of the weak map suffer linear time.

As stated by Mark Miller in the code:

> As with true WeakMaps, in this emulation, a key does not retain maps indexed by
> that key and (crucially) a map does not retain the keys it indexes. A map by
> itself also does not retain the values associated with that map.
>
> However, the values associated with a key in some map are retained so long as
> that key is retained and those associations are not overridden. For example,
> when used to support membranes, all values exported from a given membrane will
> live for the lifetime they would have had in the absence of an interposed
> membrane. Even when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been
> reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as far as the
> GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relevant to ongoing
> computation.
>
> The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented
> in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,

### Origin and license

The canonical implementation of `WeakMap` exists in the Google Caja
Subversion repository at http://google-caja.googlecode.com/svn/trunk.
It was written by Mark S. Miller.  It is released by Google with the
Apache 2.0 license.  This package is maintained by Kris Kowal.

This work began with [Mark Miller’s proposal][Proposal] for `WeakMap` to ECMA’s
TC-39, where the JavaScript standard is developed.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
