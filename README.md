# Afterglow Access

Afterglow Access is the client-side component of the Afterglow Platform.  It was developed by the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network as an accessible, web-based application allowing users to view, process, and analyze astronomical data products without the need to download large data sets or install software.  During installation,  Afterglow Access is paired with an instance of the platform's server-side component called [Afterglow Core](https://github.com/SkynetRTN/afterglow-core).  Through interactions with the Core's API, Afterglow Access provides an intutive interface for importing data, adjusting display settings, inspecting headers, performing photometry, registering and stacking images, sonifying image data, and much more.  Afterglow Access utilizes Javascript and HTML which makes it cross-platform compatible when accessed through a modern browser.
